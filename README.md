# 📚 GyanSetu Platform

_A money-free micro-mentorship exchanging platform._

The **GyanSetu Platform** connects people who want to _learn_ new skills with people who can _teach_ them — without using money.

Instead of paying, users trade **Skill Credits**: you earn credits by teaching and spend credits when learning.
This creates a fair, community-driven ecosystem perfect for students, developers, creators, hobbyists, and local learning groups.
